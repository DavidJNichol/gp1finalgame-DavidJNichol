PROBLEMS I AM AWARE OF:

Weird things can happen when player falls really fast (clipping out of bounds or through blocks) 

Player horizontal accel is too slow - poor movement feel

Monster top colliders might be a bit off

Player can shoot through platforms when standing on them

There is no win screen

Player can bounce really high while hitting monster top and shooting at the same time

Monster can deal 2 damage to player

************************************************************************

************************************************************************
Code Structure:
Player uses an input state system based on boolean input 

Collidable Object superclass

Spawnable Object superclass

Collidable Object uses an enum and a couple other variables to talk with its children

Gems are spawned in Collidable Object

Certain collider scripts do not inherit from collidable object due to special cases of collision

Each sound is generated by its own generator's script, but audiomanager.cs allows everything to be centralized to manage sounds in other places if need be

Several managers are used to organize top-down function calls

Maintainability: 
Very bad maintainability since VS. Comments are really the only thing going for me here. The realization that I was overly-ambitious sunk in towards the last week of work. I ran into several bugs and obstacles, and instead of dumbing the gameplay down, I took shortcuts and accrued technical debt in order to make the game the way I wanted it to be. I didn't attemp to implement any new patterns or cut down script weight since VS.

I kinda just make a few fat managers and leaned on those to do heavy lifting far too much. The boss scene was a bug nightmare so I had to cut a lot of gameplay and maintainability on those scripts. The boss monster only has one script called "BossScript" instead on multiple scripts(collision, movement etc.) which is terrible. 

I wanted to have something that I was proud of to look at and play instead of code i was proud to look at by presentation time, because I figured if I do that and fix the code later before it goes on my portfolio then I can save time. But now I'm realizing that it's going to be a nightmare to go back and fix up my code because I rushed the later scripts. On maintainability I'd give myself a 5.6/10.
